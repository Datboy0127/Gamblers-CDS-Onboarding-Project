Our project is analyzing arbitrage between Kalshi sports betting markets and equivalent housed markets like Draftkings. We aim to achieve this with ML time-series models. 

You can use this github by pulling and pushing through jupyter notebook and terminal. We will soon produce a dataset possibly through web scraping Kalshi and Draftkings
